# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 🚀

This project uses the powerful **YOLOv8** object detection model along with OpenCV to detect and label real-world objects like persons, cars, bottles, etc. in real-time using your webcam.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art object detection architecture by Ultralytics.
- 🖼️ **Real-Time Detection**: Processes webcam feed live.
- 🏷️ **Named Labels**: Displays actual class names (like *person*, *car*, *book*), not ID numbers.
- 🎚️ **Confidence Threshold**: Filters out low-confidence detections.
- 📦 Easy to set up and run.
